Command-line utility to search DuckDuckGo from the terminal. While googler is
extremely popular among command line users, in many forums the need of a similar
utility for privacy-aware DuckDuckGo came up. So here's `ddgr` for you!

Unlike the web interface, you can specify the number of search results you would
like to see per page. It's more convenient than skimming through 30-odd search
results per page.
The default interface is carefully designed to use minimum space without
sacrificing readability.

A big advantage of ddgr over googler is DuckDuckGo works over the Tor network.
