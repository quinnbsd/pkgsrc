GTK is a multi-platform toolkit for creating graphical user
interfaces. Offering a complete set of widgets, GTK is suitable for
projects ranging from small one-off tools to complete application
suites.

GTK has been designed from the ground up to support a range of
languages, not only C/C++.

This package contains GTK 4.
