Project description
-------------------

Currently the project provides only a pkg-config [.pc] file, pthread-stubs.pc.
The latter contains the Cflags/Libs flags applicable to programs/libraries
that use only lightweight pthread API. See the next sections for the reasoning
and implementation details.

Historically this project used to provide either:
 - a .pc file, when the C runtime was providing the pthread symbols
or
 - a .pc file and a library which implements weak stubs for the pthread symbols,
which are not available in the C runtime.

Since then, the latter case was found to have a fundamental design issue.
