sd, s[earch] & d[isplace] is an intuitive find & replace CLI.
sd uses regex syntax that you already know from JavaScript and Python.
Forget about dealing with quirks of sed or awk and get productive immediately.

Non-regex find & replace. No more backslashes or remembering which characters
are special and need to be escaped.

Find & replace expressions are split up, which makes them easy to read and
write. No more messing with unclosed and escaped slashes.

While sed does a whole lot more, sd focuses on doing just one thing and doing
it well.
