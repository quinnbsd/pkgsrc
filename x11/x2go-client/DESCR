X2Go is a Remote Desktop solution: It enables you to access a
computer's graphical desktop over the network.

X2Go works well over a low bandwidth connection.

The Unix computer you are accessing is the X2Go Server (there are ways
to connect to a Windows computer as well).

You can connect from a computer running Unix, Windows or Mac OS
X. This computer is the X2Go Client.

Multiple users/clients can access a single X2Go Server at the same
time, with each user/client having an individual Desktop session by
default - however, Desktop sharing (Remote Assistance) is possible,
too.

For the graphical part of remote desktop sessions, X2Go uses No
Machine NX3 technology under the hood.
