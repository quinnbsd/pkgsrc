Twisted is a framework, written in Python, for writing networked applications.
It includes implementations of a number of commonly used network services such
as a web server, an IRC chat server, a mail server, a relational database
interface and an object broker. Developers can build applications using all of
these services as well as custom services that they write themselves. Twisted
also includes a user authentication system that controls access to services
and provides services with user context information to implement their own
security models.

Note that while this package provides most of Twisted, Twisted Conch
(SSH client/server) only functions if security/py-amkCrypto is also
installed.
